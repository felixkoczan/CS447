# How NLP Powers Music Recommendations

This repository contains my research paper titled **"How NLP Powers Music Recommendations: The Role of Neural Summarization and Sentiment Analysis"**.

## Overview
The paper explores how Natural Language Processing techniques—particularly **neural summarization** and **sentiment analysis**—can enhance music recommendation systems by leveraging user-generated content like reviews, playlists, and lyrics. It demonstrates how user intent and emotional tone can be extracted to inform personalization.

## Key Topics
- Abstractive summarization using Pointer-Generator Networks and Transformer models
- Sentiment classification and Connotation Frames
- Human-in-the-loop recommendation systems
- Text-based profiling for music curation
